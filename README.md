## graph of amsterdam
We made a Graph of all the stops in amsterdam using NetworkX. To make this graph execute the following program: static_data_processing_for_graph.py

### Networkx
To install NetworkX (Python): pip install networkx 

### Other libraries
We use Matplotlib to plot the graph and the requests module to make a HTTP request, so make sure those are installed on your machine if you want to run our code.
