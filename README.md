# Analytics
Python analytics from Prometheus DB


## Graph of amsterdam
We made a Graph of all the stops in amsterdam using NetworkX. To make this graph execute the following program:
```bash
    python3 static_data_processing_for_graph.py
```

### Networkx
To install NetworkX (Python):
```bash
    pip install networkx
```

### Other libraries
We use Matplotlib to plot the graph and the requests module to make a HTTP request, so make sure those are installed on your machine if you want to run our code.
